        <p>
          <b>1. Interactive Quiz Application(C++, HTML, CSS):</b> Description:
          Developed an interactive quiz application using C++. Users can answer
          questions, and the program provides feedback on correctness. The HTML
          and CSS part comes into play when creating a simple web interface for
          the quiz. ~ Skills Highlighted: C++ logic, file I/O, HTML form
          elements, and CSS styling.
        </p>

          <b>2. Line-following robot(Robotics, Control System)</b> My autonomous
          robot is designed to follow a black line on a white surface using
          infrared sensors. It detects the line and adjusts its movement
          accordingly. I utilized an Arduino Uno, two IR sensors, a motor
          driver, and two DC motors. The IR sensors sense the reflected light
          from the surface, allowing the robot to navigate along the line. ~
          Skills Highlighted: Successfully built and programmed this robot,
          demonstrating my skills in robotics and control systems.

          <b>3. Online Banking Application (C++, HTML, CSS):</b> Implemented an
          Online Banking Application with a C++ backend handling transaction
          processing and account management. The frontend was developed using
          HTML and CSS, providing users with a secure and user-friendly
          interface for banking operations. This showcased versatility in
          programming languages and the ability to create a secure and
          responsive web application. ~ Skills Highlighted: C++ file handling,
          HTML structure, CSS layout.
