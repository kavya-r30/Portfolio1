          Understanding of fundamental concepts like variables, data types, and
          control structures. Proficiency in functions, classes, and
          object-oriented programming principles, along with memory management
          awareness, is essential for effective C++ programming

        <p>
          Make websites that are responsive and appealing, whatever size of
